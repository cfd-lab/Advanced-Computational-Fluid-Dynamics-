Description:

In our treatment of the physics of fluid flows we have added a summary of basic ideas underpinning Direct Numerical Simulations and Numerical Analysis. 
This course thoroughly introduce the coding based methods for the numerical problems and differential equations. 
The course is divided into three parts, the first half covers basic theoretical and physical descriptions of Fundamental Equations and Modern CFD. 
The second half will cover the transformation of differential equations into the algebraic equations, differencing methods and discretization methods. 
The last part contain the numerical analysis in the form of MATLAB and C++ coding. 
Coding based problems are tackled well in this course, so that the student of different backgrounds will learn more about related domains.

If you are beginner to Computational Fluid Dynamics please go through our course Fundamentals of CFD with Hands on Experience.

The successful completion of this course (Theory + Practical) would help students in achieving the following objectives, which are:

To provide a sound background in the mathematics, physics of numerical analysis and computational fluid
To conduct an effective CFD simulation of an unsteady turbulent
To understand the underlying concept of Navier Stroke Equation
To build a basic understanding of the equations used in different turbulence
Will have a strong understanding about the software which will be used in this
To develop the understanding by applying mathematical models to simple realizable configurations along with practical
To apprehend the applications/solutions of models developed in the advanced course in industrial applications using analytical as well as numerical
